catalogue               This method runs the DBSCAN algorithm (if
                        cluster_id is NULL) and obtains the mean
                        positivity rate (PR) of each cluster extended
                        with the non-infected cases closer than the
                        link_d.
dbscan                  This method finds the DBSCAN clusters from a
                        set of positions and returns their cluster IDs.
temporal_catalogue      This method generates a list of EpiFRIenDs
                        catalogues representing different time frames
                        by including only cases within a time window
                        that moves within each time step.
