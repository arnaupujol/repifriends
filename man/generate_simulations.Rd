\arguments{
\item{positions}{data.frame with the positions of parameters we want to query 
with shape (n,2) where n is the number of positions.}

\item{test_result}{data.frame with the test results (0 or 1).}

\item{link_d}{The linking distance to connect cases. Should be in the same 
scale as the positions.}

\item{n_simulations}{Number of random simulations to be performed.}

\item{min_neighbours}{Minium number of neighbours in the radius < link_d needed 
to link cases as friends.}

\item{max_p}{Maximum value of the p-value to consider the cluster detection.}

\item{min_pos}{Threshold of minimum number of positive cases in clusters applied.}

\item{min_total}{Threshold of minimum number of cases in clusters applied.}

\item{min_pr}{Threshold of minimum positivity rate in clusters applied.}

\item{keep_null_tests}{Whether to remove or not missings. If numeric, provide 
value to impute.}

\item{use_link_d:}{If True, use linking distance to determine the closest neighbours. 
If False, use default linking neighbours based on proximity.}

\item{min_neighbours:}{Minium number of neighbours in the radius < link_d needed to 
link cases as friends.}

\item{link_neighbours:}{Number of surrounding neighbors to link.}

\item{cluster_id}{Numeric vector with the cluster IDs of each position, with 
0 for those without a cluster. Give NULL if cluster_id must be calculated.}

\item{in_latlon:}{If True, x and y coordinates are treated as longitude and 
latitude respectively, otherwise they are treated as cartesian coordinates.}

\item{to_epsg:}{If in_latlon is True, x and y are reprojected to this EPSG.}

\item{verbose:}{If TRUE, print information of the process; else, do not print.}

\item{run_seq:}{If TRUE, run sequentially instead of parallelizing.}
}
\value{
data.frame with the number of isolated positives detected per iteration 
and its frequency.

# Creation of x vector of longitude coordinates, y vector of latitude coordinates

# Creation of test data frame with 0 for negative cases and 1 for positive clases for each position.
